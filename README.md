# R Data Analysis Repository
**Analysis and Visualization with R for various datasets.**

#### The main goal of the repo is to understand in depth the most famous libraries in R language such as **dplyr**, **tidyverse**, **tidyr**, **ggplot2**, **leaflet** in order to use them for tidy data transformation and plotting.

This repository was initially created to store my personal R Markdowns but also be available to others trying to build or understand something similar.
The R codes contained in this repo are made specifically for an EDAV course of my MSc program.
