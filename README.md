# R Data Analysis Repository
**Analysis and Visualization with R for various datasets.**

#### The main goal of the repo is to understand in depth the most famous libraries in R language and visualize various datasets. The will be in format of R Markdown and R Shiny Dashboard.

### Briefly, the repo contains:

  • **R_(1) Simple R functions - Dataset tidyr::who.** Using the simplest R functions to transform the dataset into tidy format.
  
  • **R_(2) Simple R plots with ggplot2 - Datasets queen & mcdonalds.** Plotting the simplest possible R plots. Dataset _queen.csv_ contains characteristics for each song of the Queen albums as derived from Spotify. Mcdonalds.csv contains the price of Big-Mac in local currency for various countries and years. In general, this R Markdown contains Faceted ScatterPlots, BoxPlots, Histograms and BarPlots.
  
  • **R_(3) Rules, Correcting, Imputing with R - Dataset dirty_iris.** With the use of _deducorrect_, _editrules_ and _VIM_ the dataset is transofrmed into tidy. In general, this R Markdown contains numerical and caterogical rules, violations, hotdeck imputation and lastly some plots.
  
  • **R_(4) Visualization of the Olympic Games with R - Dataset results.** Dataset _results.csv_ contains results of the track and field events of all the Olympic Games events until 2016. In general, this R Markdown contains the preprocessing steps as well as univariate and multivariate analysis, time series analysis techniques and interesting graphs for this dataset.
  
  • **R_(5) Interactive Maps with use of cshapes, leaflet and tmap (Dashboard Included) - Dataset world from cshapes.** Manage and visualize geographic data with world datset from cshapes. This folder contains both R Markdown and Shiny Dashboard. Distance thresholds, buffer from capitals, distance from country's centroid are included. 
  
  • **R_(6) Grap plots and shortest paths (Dashboard Included) - Dataset world from cshapes.** Manage and visualize network data again with world datset from cshapes. This folder contains also both R Markdown and Shiny Dashboard. Directed graph of capitals and their distances, shortest path between capitals considering weight distance or total number of nodes are included.

This repository was initially created to store my personal R Markdowns but also be available to others trying to build or understand something similar.
The R codes contained in this repo are made specifically for an EDAV course of my MSc program.
