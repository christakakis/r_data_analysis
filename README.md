# R Data Analysis Repository
**Analysis and Visualization with R for various datasets.**

#### The main goal of the repo is to understand in depth the most famous libraries in R language and visualize various datasets. The codes will be presented in format of R Markdown and R Shiny Dashboard.

### Briefly, the repo contains:

  • **(1) [Simple R functions](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(1)%20Simple%20R%20functions) - Dataset tidyr::who.** Using the simplest R functions to transform the dataset into tidy format.
  
  • **(2) [Simple R plots with ggplot2](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(2)%20Simple%20R%20plots%20with%20ggplot2) - Datasets queen & mcdonalds.** Plotting the simplest possible R plots. Dataset _queen.csv_ contains characteristics for each song of the Queen albums as derived from Spotify. Mcdonalds.csv contains the price of Big-Mac in local currency for various countries and years. In general, this R Markdown contains Faceted ScatterPlots, BoxPlots, Histograms and BarPlots.
  
  • **(3) [Rules, Correcting, Imputing with R](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(3)%20Rules%2C%20Correcting%2C%20Imputing%20with%20R) - Dataset dirty_iris.** With the use of _deducorrect_, _editrules_ and _VIM_ the dataset is transofrmed into tidy. In general, this R Markdown contains numerical and caterogical rules, violations, hotdeck imputation and lastly some plots.
  
  • **(4) [Visualization of the Olympic Games with R](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(4)%20Visualization%20of%20the%20Olympic%20Games%20with%20R) - Dataset results.** Dataset _results.csv_ contains results of the track and field events of all the Olympic Games events until 2016. In general, this R Markdown contains the preprocessing steps as well as univariate and multivariate analysis, time series analysis techniques and interesting graphs for this dataset.
  
  • **(5) [Interactive Maps with use of cshapes, leaflet and tmap (Dashboard Included)](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(5)%20Interactive%20Maps%20with%20use%20of%20cshapes%2C%20leaflet%20and%20tmap%20(Dashboard%20Included)) - Dataset world from cshapes.** Manage and visualize geographic data with world datset from cshapes. This folder contains both R Markdown and Shiny Dashboard. Distance thresholds, buffer from capitals, distance from country's centroid are included. 
  
  • **(6) [Graph plots and shortest paths (Dashboard Included)](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(6)%20Graph%20plots%20and%20shortest%20paths%20(Dashboard%20Included)) - Dataset world from cshapes.** Manage and visualize network data again with world datset from cshapes. This folder contains also both R Markdown and Shiny Dashboard. Directed graph of capitals and their distances, shortest path between capitals considering weight distance or total number of nodes are included.
  
  • **(7) [Interesting interactive visualizations (Dashboard Included)](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(7)%20Interesting%20interactive%20visualizations%20(Dashboard%20Included)) - Dataset album.** Managing data about music albums, their genres, titles, year and artists. The Dashboard is available for preview on my account on [ShinyApps](https://christakakis.shinyapps.io/Dashboard-Albums/).

  • **(8) [Visualizations of NYPD shooting incidents (Dashboard Included)](https://github.com/christakakis/r_data_analysis/tree/main/(8)%20Visualizations%20of%20NYPD%20shooting%20incidents%20(Dashboard%20Included)) - Various Datasets.** Managing data about NYC shootings and trying to plot something interesting.

This repository was initially created to store my personal R Markdowns but also be available to others trying to build or understand something similar.
The R codes contained in this repo are made specifically for an EDAV course of my MSc program.
